## License note
As you might notice, this project is licensed under the Unlicense. Motivation for that is simple: everything is hamstrung together using dozens of sources online; it seemed silly to take much credit for it all or impose any conditions. That being said, feel free to credit or not credit me as long as your own conscience is fine with that :P.

### Have fun!
